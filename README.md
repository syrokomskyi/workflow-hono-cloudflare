# Experiments with Cloudflare Workers

See git logs for details.

Welcome to Cloudflare Workers! This is your first Durable Objects application.

- Run `npm run dev` in your terminal to start a development server
- Open a browser tab at <http://localhost:8787/> to see your Durable Object in action
- Run `npm run deploy` to publish your application

Bind resources to your worker in `wrangler.toml`. After adding bindings, a type definition for the `Env` object can be regenerated with `npm run cf-typegen`.
